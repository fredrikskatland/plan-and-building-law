Section 11-15.  Adoption of the municipal master plan
The municipal council itself adopts the municipal master plan. If the municipal council intends to make a decision on the land-use element of the municipal master plan entailing a use of land that has not been the subject of consultation during the consideration of the plan, those parts of the plan where alterations are sought must be taken up for renewed consideration.
The plan shall be announced and made available through electronic media. A copy of the plan shall be sent to the Ministry, county governor, regional planning authority and affected central government authorities.
The municipal council's decision on the municipal master plan may not be appealed.
