Section 12-4.Â Legal effect of a zoning plan
A zoning plan lays down future land use for the area concerned and, when adopted by the municipal council, is binding for new projects or extension of existing projects as mentioned in section 1-6. The plan applies from the time it is adopted by the municipal council, unless the matter is to be decided by the Ministry pursuant to section 12-13.
Projects pursuant to section 1-6, first paragraph, including alteration of use pursuant to section 31-2, see also section 1-6, second paragraph, must not conflict with the plan's land-use objectives and provisions.
The zoning plan shall be complied with when deciding applications for permits or when managing projects pursuant to section 20-1, first paragraph (a) to (m), see sections 20-2 and 20-3.
A zoning plan is a basis for expropriation pursuant to the provisions of chapter 16.
Where a development project, authorised in a plan put forward with a basis in a private zoning proposal pursuant to section 12-11, has not been initiated at the latest five years after adoption of the plan, a permit to implement the plan may not be granted unless a new planning decision is adopted. The planning decision may, upon application from the developer, be extended by up to two years at a time. Where a general permit for a project has been granted within the time limit of five years with possible extension(s), the three-year time limit set out in section 21-9 applies to the project.
