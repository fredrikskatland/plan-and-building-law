Section 15-2. Landowner’s right to demand redemption in connection with a zoning plan
Where a zoning plan entails that the municipality, or other legal entity with the consent of the municipality, has the right pursuant to section 16-2 to expropriate an undeveloped property in its entirety, the landowner or the lessee may demand immediate expropriation where the decision relates to land which is designated in the plan as public traffic areas, public recreation areas, common areas, or for central government, county and municipal buildings and cemeteries and cremation gravesites.
The same applies where the right of expropriation encompasses an undeveloped part of a property if the expropriation will cause the property to no longer be regarded as fit to be utilised, based on the entire property’s size, location or other factors, in a profitable manner.
Claims pursuant to the first paragraph must be filed at the latest three years after the zoning plan was announced pursuant to section 12-12, fourth and fifth paragraphs, or a decision was made known pursuant to section 12-12, last paragraph. If the land is undeveloped, the landowner or lessee has the same rights once the buildings have been removed. The claim must in such case be filed at the latest three years after this point in time.
