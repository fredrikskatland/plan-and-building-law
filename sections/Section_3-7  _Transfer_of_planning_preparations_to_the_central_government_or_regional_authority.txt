Section 3-7.   Transfer of planning preparations to the central government or regional authority
By further agreement between the parties, the central government or regional authority may take over all or part of the functions of the municipal planning administration and regional planning authorities relating to the organisation of planning work and preparation of planning proposals.
If agreement cannot be reached between the authority concerned and the municipality or regional planning authority regarding the organisation of planning work, the decision is made by the Ministry.
Authorities responsible for major transport and communications installations and technical infrastructure may, after consultation with the planning authorities, prepare and present proposals for land-use plans for such projects and decide to present such plans for public scrutiny pursuant to the provisions governing the type of plans in question. Current municipal or regional planning strategies shall be reviewed in connection with the planning work.

Planning is otherwise subject to the ordinary provisions regarding the consideration and legal effect of the type of plan in question.
