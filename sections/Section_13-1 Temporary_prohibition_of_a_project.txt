Section 13-1. Temporary prohibition of a project
If the municipality or authority concerned finds that an area should be subject to new planning, it may decide that establishment and alteration of a property or project pursuant to section 1-6 and other projects that are liable to complicate the planning work may not be initiated until the planning question is finally decided.
The municipality may consent to a project as mentioned in the first paragraph being implemented if in the municipality’s judgement it will not impede planning.
If the envisaged plan relates to land for conversion/transformation(??) and renovation involving a zone requiring special consideration and special forms of cooperation and ownership, see sections 11-8(e) and 12-6, the municipality may also decide that the landowner or rights holder may not, without the consent of the municipality, have legal disposal over property in a manner liable to impede or raise the cost of implementing the plan. The municipality shall have such decision registered on the affected properties.
