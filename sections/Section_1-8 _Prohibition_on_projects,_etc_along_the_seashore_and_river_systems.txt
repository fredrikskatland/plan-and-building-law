Section 1-8.Â  Prohibition on projects, etc. along the seashore and river systems
In the 100-meter belt along the seashore and river systems, special consideration shall be given to the natural and cultural environment, outdoor recreation, landscape and other elements of public interest.
Projects pursuant to section 1-6, first paragraph, other than alterations to the exterior of a building may not be implemented closer to the sea than 100 metres from the shoreline measured in a horizontal plane at ordinary high tide. However, this does not preclude the sectioning off of land in connection with the redemption of a developed leasehold site pursuant to the Site Leasehold Act.
The prohibition pursuant to the second paragraph applies insofar as no other building limit has been determined in the land-use element of the municipal master plan or the zoning plan, see section 11-9, no. 5 and section 12-7, no. 2.
The prohibition pursuant to the second paragraph does not apply where the municipality, in the land-use element of the municipal master plan, has permitted the erection of necessary buildings, small installations and storage facilities for use in agriculture, reindeer husbandry, fishing, aquaculture or sea traffic, see section 11-11, no. 4.
In the case of areas along river systems that are significant for nature, cultural environment and outdoor recreation interests, the municipality shall in the land-use element of the municipal master plan pursuant to section 11-11, no. 5, fix a limit of up to 100 metres within which specifically defined projects, etc. shall not be permitted.
