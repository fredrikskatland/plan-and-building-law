Section 3-6.Â  Common planning functions
The central government and regional authorities may begin work on plans pursuant to this Act in areas where the central government, the regional planning authority and the municipalities have a common responsibility for discharging planning functions of regional or national significance, including coordinated land-use and transport planning, planning of large continuous nature and outdoor recreation areas around towns and urban areas, coordinated water planning and coastal zone planning.
The King makes regulations stipulating which functions, areas and authorities this concerns, including the fact that common planning provisions regarding the conduct of commercial activities and regarding traffic may be laid down in respect of plans for large continuous nature and outdoor recreation areas around towns and urban areas.
