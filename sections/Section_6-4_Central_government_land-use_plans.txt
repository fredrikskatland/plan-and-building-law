Section 6-4. Central government land-use plans
When the implementation of important central government or regional development, construction or conservation projects so requires, or when it is justified by other social considerations, the Ministry may request the municipality in question to prepare the land-use element of the municipal master plan or the zoning plan pursuant to chapters 11 and 12 of the Act.
The Ministry may itself prepare and adopt such a plan subject to the same conditions. In such case, the Ministry shall assume the authority of the municipal council. The municipality in question shall provide the Ministry with all necessary assistance in this work.
The Ministry may in individual cases decide that the final licence for a power plant granted pursuant to the Energy Act, the Water Resources Act or the Watercourse Regulation Act shall automatically have the effect of a central government land-use plan. The Ministryâ€™s decisions pursuant to this paragraph may not be appealed.
