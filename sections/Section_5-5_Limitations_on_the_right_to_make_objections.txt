Section 5-5. Limitations on the right to make objections
No new objection may be made to matters determined in the land-use objectives and provisions against which objections have previously been made, and which have been decided in the course of the preceding ten years. Nor may objections be made to matters in a planning case to which objections could have been made in connection with a previous plan concerning the same matters which was adopted in the course of the ten preceding years. If the municipality and the body making the objection disagree as to whether the right to make objections pursuant to this provision is precluded, the Ministry shall decide the issue.
In cases as described in the first paragraph, third sentence, the municipalityâ€™s planning decision shall not take effect until the Ministry has decided that the right to make objections is precluded. If the Ministry finds that the right to make objections is unaffected, the case shall be dealt with further in the ordinary manner.
The right to make objections ceases to apply if the requirement of public participation in the planning process pursuant to section 3-2, third paragraph, has not been fulfilled, provided that the planning authority has fulfilled its duty of notification and the requirements regarding notification for the type of plan in question.
Section 5-6. Mediation and decision by the MinistryIf the municipality finds that it cannot take account of the objection, mediation shall ordinarily be undertaken between the parties. If no agreement is reached, the municipality shall adopt the plan and sends the plan and the objection, together with the recommendation of the mediator, to the Ministry. The Ministry decides whether the objection shall be upheld and the plan amended.

The King decides who shall be the mediator.
