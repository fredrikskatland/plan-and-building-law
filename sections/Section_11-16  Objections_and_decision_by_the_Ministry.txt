Section 11-16.  Objections and decision by the Ministry
Sections 5-4 to 5-6 apply to objections to the land-use element of the municipal master plan. If the objections relate to clearly delimited parts of the plan, the municipal council may nonetheless decide that the remaining parts of the land-use element of the municipal master plan shall have legal effect.
The Ministry decides whether the objections shall be upheld and may in that connection make such alterations to the land-use element of the municipal master plan as it deems necessary.
The Ministry may, even where no objection has been raised, revoke the entire plan or parts of it or make such alterations as it deems necessary, if the plan is contrary to national interests or a regional master plan. The municipality shall have had the opportunity to express its view before the Ministry makes a decision. If it is possible that alterations will be made to the plan, the Ministry must inform the municipality thereof within three months of receiving the plan.
The Ministry's decision may not be appealed.
