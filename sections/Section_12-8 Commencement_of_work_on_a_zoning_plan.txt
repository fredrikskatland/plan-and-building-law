Section 12-8.Â Commencement of work on a zoning plan
When planning work is commenced, affected public bodies and other interested parties shall be notified. Where the proposer is a party other than the planning authority itself, the planning question shall be put before the planning authority at a meeting. The municipality may give advice on how the plan should be prepared, and may assist in the planning work.
The proposer shall in all cases publish notification of the commencement of planning work in at least one newspaper that is commonly read in the locality, and through electronic means. Registered landowners and lessees in the planning area, and as far as possible other rights holders in the planning area and neighbours to the planning area, shall, when they become directly affected, be informed in an appropriate manner that the planning work is to go ahead.
Upon notification of commencement and announcement of the planning work, the boundary of the planning area shall be stated.
