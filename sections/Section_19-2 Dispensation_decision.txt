Section 19-2. Dispensation decision
The municipality may grant permanent or temporary dispensation from provisions made in or pursuant to this Act. Conditions may be imposed for such dispensation.
Dispensation may not be granted if the considerations behind the provision from which dispensation is granted, or the considerations in the Act’s objects clause, are significantly disregarded. In addition, the advantages of granting dispensation must clearly outweigh the disadvantages based on an overall assessment. Dispensation from rules of procedure may not be granted.
When dispensation is granted from the Act and regulations to the Act, particular emphasis shall be given to the consequences of such dispensation for health, the environment, safety and accessibility.
In the assessment of whether dispensation from plans should be granted, central government and regional frameworks and goals must be assigned particular importance. Moreover, the community should not grant dispensation from plans, provisions of the Act regarding plans and the prohibition in section 1-8 where a directly affected central government or regional authority has expressed a negative view on the application for dispensation.
The King may by regulations set a time limit for processing dispensation cases.
