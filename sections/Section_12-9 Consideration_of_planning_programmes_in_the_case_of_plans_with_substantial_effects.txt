Section 12-9.Â Consideration of planning programmes in the case of plans with substantial effects
In the case of plans which may have substantial effects on the environment and society, planning programmes shall be drawn up pursuant to the provisions of section 4-1. The planning programme may be omitted in the case of specified zoning plans that are in accordance with the land-use element of the municipal master plan or area zoning plan and where the effects are satisfactorily described in an overall plan.
A proposal for a planning programme shall be circulated for comment and presented for public scrutiny at the latest upon notification of commencement and announcement of the planning work. The proposal shall also be made available in at least one newspaper that is commonly read in the locality and through electronic means. The time limit for comment shall be at least six weeks.
The planning programme shall ordinarily be determined by the municipal council. The municipal council may delegate authority pursuant to the provisions of the Local Government Act.
When considering the planning programme the municipal council may decide that an area zoning plan shall be implemented if this is necessary for proper plan clarification and plan implementation in respect of building and construction projects, multi-use and conservation in relation to affected private and public interests.
