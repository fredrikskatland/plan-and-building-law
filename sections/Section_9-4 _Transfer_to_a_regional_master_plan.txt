Section 9-4.Â  Transfer to a regional master plan
A majority of the municipalities may at any time request the regional planning authority to take over the planning work as a regional master plan, on the basis of the planning work that has been done.
The regional planning authority and the central government authority may request municipalities to cause the work to be continued as a regional master plan when this is considered necessary in order to safeguard considerations and discharge functions that extend beyond the individual municipality. A majority of the municipalities may consent to this.
The Ministry may decide that the planning work shall be continued in the form of a regional master plan. The municipalities shall be given an opportunity to express their views before such a decision is made.
