Section 12-13.  Objection and decision by the Ministry
Sections 5-4 to 5-6 apply in respect of objections to a zoning plan. If the objection relates to clearly delimited parts of the plan, the municipal council may nonetheless decide that the other parts of the zoning plan shall have legal effect.
The Ministry shall decide whether the objections shall be upheld and may in that connection make such alterations to the zoning plan as are considered necessary.
The Ministry may, even if no objection has been made, revoke parts of the plan or make such alterations as are considered necessary, if the plan conflicts with national interests or a regional master plan. This also applies where the plan conflicts with the land-use element of the municipal master plan. The municipality shall have had an opportunity to express its view before the Ministry makes a decision.
The Ministry’s decision may not be appealed.
