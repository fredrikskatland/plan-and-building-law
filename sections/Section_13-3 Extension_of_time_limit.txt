Section 13-3. Extension of time limit
The municipality may in special cases extend the time limit. Such decision must be made within the expiry of the time limit.
When extending the time-limit the municipality or the Ministry may decide that affected landowners shall, immediately or from a specific point in time, be given the right to demand redemption as if the property – or that part of the property that is affected by the building prohibition – had been zoned as a public traffic area, public outdoor recreation area, common area or area designated for transformation (conversion??) and renovation or for state, regional and municipal buildings and cemeteries and cremation gravesites. The provisions of section 15-2 are given corresponding application.
