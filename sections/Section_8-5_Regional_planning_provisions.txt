Section 8-5. Regional planning provisions
The regional planning authority may lay down regional planning provisions related to guidelines for land use in a regional master plan intended to safeguard national or regional considerations and interests. The provision may determine that a prohibition is imposed for a period of up to ten years on the implementation of certain specified building or construction projects without consent within delimited geographical areas, or may decide that without such consent such projects may only be implemented in accordance with approved land-use plans pursuant to this Act.
Proposals for regional planning provisions shall be prepared and considered in accordance with the provisions of sections 8-3 and 8-4, and may be presented in connection with the preparation of a regional master plan.
The regional planning authority may, after consultation with the county governor and affected municipalities, extend the prohibition for five years at a time.
Consent for the implementation of projects to which a regional planning provision applies may be given by the regional planning authority after consultation with the county governor and affected municipalities.
Regional planning provisions shall be announced in the Norwegian Legal Gazette and made available through electronic media. A copy of the planning provision shall be sent to the Ministry, the county governor and affected municipalities and central government authorities.
