Section 19-3.Â Temporary dispensation
Temporary dispensation may be granted on a time-limited or indefinite basis. Upon the expiry of the dispensation period, or when ordered to do so, the applicant must at no expense to the municipality remove or alter the work done, or cease the temporarily permitted use, or fulfil the requirement whose postponement has been granted and, if required, restore the previous conditions.
Dispensation may be rendered conditional by a declaration in which also the owner or lessee for his part accepts these obligations. Registration of the declaration may be demanded. It is binding on mortgagees and other rights holders in the property regardless of when the right was created and regardless of whether the declaration is registered.
