Section 8-4. Adoption of regional master plans
The regional master plan shall be finally adopted by the regional planning authority unless the matter is submitted to the Ministry pursuant to the provision in the second paragraph, or other provision is made by regulations to section 8-1, second paragraph. The municipalities, county governor and affected central government bodies shall be notified of the adoption of the plan. A copy of the plan shall be sent to the ministries for their information.
If a central government body, out of consideration for national or central government interests in that bodyâ€™s sphere of responsibility, or a municipality that will be directly affected by the plan, has substantial objections to the goals or guidelines of the plan, it may demand that the matter be submitted to the Ministry, which may make such alterations as are considered necessary. The same applies to the adoption of a regional planning provision pursuant to section 8-5.
Even if the matter is not submitted to the Ministry pursuant to the preceding paragraph, the Ministry may, after the regional planning authority has been given the opportunity to express its view, make alterations to the plan on the basis of national interests. The regional planning authority must be informed that the plan will be altered within three months after its receipt by the Ministry.
