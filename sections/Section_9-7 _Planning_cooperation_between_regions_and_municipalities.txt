Section 9-7.Â  Planning cooperation between regions and municipalities
The provisions of this chapter apply correspondingly to planning cooperation between one or more regions and one or more municipalities.
The Ministry may impose such planning cooperation when it is necessary in order to discharge planning functions for large areas collectively. In this respect, the Ministry may make provisions regarding the purpose of cooperation, to which functions cooperation shall apply, which geographic area it shall cover, the organisation of necessary cooperative bodies, and the participation of the central government. Before such provisions are made, the regions and municipalities in question shall be given an opportunity to express their views.
