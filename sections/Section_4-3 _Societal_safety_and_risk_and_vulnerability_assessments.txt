Section 4-3.Â  Societal safety and risk and vulnerability assessments
When preparing development plans, the planning authority shall make sure that a risk and vulnerability assessment is carried out for the planning area, or shall itself carry out such an assessment. The assessment shall show all the risk and vulnerability factors of significance for determining whether the land is suitable for development purposes, and any changes in such factors as a result of the planned development. Areas where there is a danger, risk or vulnerability shall be indicated in the plan as an area requiring special consideration, see sections 11-8 and 12-6. In land-use plans, the planning authority shall adopt such provisions regarding development in the zone, including prohibitions, as are necessary to prevent damage and loss.
The King may make regulations regarding risk and vulnerability assessments.
