Section 5-4. Authority to make an objection to a planning proposal
Affected central government and regional bodies may make objections to proposals regarding the land-use element of the municipal master plan and the zoning plan in issues that are of national or significant regional importance, or which for other reasons are of significant importance to the sphere of responsibility of the body in question.
Other municipalities may make objections to proposals for such plans in respect of issues that are of significant importance to the municipality’s inhabitants, for business and industry or for the natural or cultural environment in the municipality, or for the municipality’s own activities or planning.
The Sami Parliament may make objections to such plans in respect of issues that are of significant importance to Sami culture or the conduct of commercial activities.
If the planning proposal is contrary to provisions of this Act, regulations, central government planning guidelines, central government or regional planning provisions, or a general plan, objections may be made.
Objections shall be made as early as possible and at the latest within the time limit set for the consultation process for the planning proposal. Grounds shall be given for objections.
