Section 2-1. Maps and geodata
The municipality shall ensure that there is an up-to-date, public set of basic map data for the objectives specified in the Act. The central government authorities shall make national map data available to all municipalities. Central government, regional and municipal bodies shall organise geodata in such a way as to ensure that the information is readily available for use in processing planning and building applications. The basic map data must also be available for use for other public and private purposes.
The municipality may require any person who presents a plan proposal or project application to prepare maps, when this is necessary in order to be able to make a decision on the proposal or application. The municipality may incorporate such maps into public sector basic map data. The municipality may require that planning proposals, applications and maps be submitted in digital format.
The King may decide that national or local projects shall be initiated to collect, check, revise or supplement information on planning and building matters and public sector basic map data. The King may order public bodies to provide such information as is necessary in order to carry out the project.
The Ministry may make regulations regarding maps and geodata.
