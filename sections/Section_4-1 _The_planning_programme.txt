Section 4-1.Â  The planning programme
In the case of all regional and municipal plans, and zoning plans that may have significant impacts on the environment and society, a planning programme shall be drawn up, as part of notification of the start of planning, to serve as a basis for the planning work.
The planning programme shall give an account of the purpose of the planning work, the planning process with time limits and participants, arrangements for public participation, particularly in relation to groups presumed to be particularly affected, the alternatives that will be considered and the need for assessments. A proposal for the planning programme shall be circulated for comment and presented for public scrutiny at the same time as notification is given of the start of planning. The planning programme shall ordinarily be determined by the planning authority.
If, on the basis of a proposed planning programme, any regional and central government authorities affected consider that the plan may conflict with national or important regional considerations, this shall be stated in the comment on the proposed planning programme.
If the plan will have significant environmental impacts in another state, the planning authority shall send a proposal for a programme for the planning work to the authorities affected in that state for comment.
