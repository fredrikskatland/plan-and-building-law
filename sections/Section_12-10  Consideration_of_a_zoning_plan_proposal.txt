Section 12-10.  Consideration of a zoning plan proposal
A proposal for a zoning plan shall be circulated for comment and presented for public scrutiny. The planning proposal shall be made available through electronic means. The time limit for comment and for making any objection shall be at least six weeks. Zoning plans with guidelines or limits for future development which may have substantial effects on the environment and society shall contain an impact assessment, see section 4-2, second paragraph. An impact assessment may be omitted in the case of specified zoning plans that are in accordance with the land-use element of the municipal master plan or an area zoning plan and where the effects are satisfactorily described in an overall plan.
Registered landowners and lessees, and as far as possible other rights holders in the planning area and neighbours shall, when they become directly affected, be informed in an appropriate manner of the proposed zoning plan and of where it is available.
When the time limit for comment expires the municipality shall take the matter up for consideration with the comments received.
Section 12-11 also applies to private zoning proposals.
