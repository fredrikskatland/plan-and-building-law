Section 15-1. Landowner’s right to demand redemption in connection with the land-use element of the municipal master plan
If an undeveloped property or a major part of such property is designated in the land-use element of the municipal master plan as land for public traffic areas, public outdoor recreation areas, common areas, public recreation areas or for central government, county and municipal buildings and cemeteries and cremation gravesites, and the property is not zoned or designated for other purposes in the land-use element within four years, the landowner or lessee may demand compensation based on appraisement, or that expropriation be undertaken immediately, if the restrictions imposed entail that the property can no longer be utilised profitably. If the land is developed, the owner or lessee has the same rights once the buildings have been removed.
