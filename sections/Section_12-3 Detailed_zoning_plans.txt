Section 12-3. Detailed zoning plans
Detailed zoning plans are used to follow up the land-use element of the municipal master plan and, in the event, any requirements established in an adopted area zoning plan. Detailed zoning plans may supplement or alter an adopted zoning plan.
Private bodies, developers, organisations and other authorities are entitled to put forward proposals for detailed zoning plans, including supplementary plans, in respect of concrete building and construction projects and land-use alterations, and to have the municipality consider, and to elicit the municipality’s position, on the zoning issue addressed in the private proposal.
The substance of private proposals must comply with the main features and limits in the land-use element of the municipal master plan and existing area zoning plans. Section 4-2, second paragraph, applies in respect of substantial deviations.
Zoning plans shall be prepared by experts.
