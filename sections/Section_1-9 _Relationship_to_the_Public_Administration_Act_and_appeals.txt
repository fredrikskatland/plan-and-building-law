Section 1-9.Â  Relationship to the Public Administration Act and appeals
The Public Administration Act applies with the special provisions laid down in this Act.
In connection with the building application no appeal may be lodged regarding matters that have been decided in a binding zoning plan or by dispensation, and where the time limit for appealing these decisions has expired. If it is deemed to be expedient, the merits of the appeal may be considered instead of summarily dismissing the appeal.
Any central government body, including the Sami Parliament, regional body or municipality that is affected may appeal against individual decisions pursuant to this Act if the decision directly affects the sphere of responsibility of the authority concerned. However, this does not apply in planning matters where the authority concerned has been given the opportunity to make an objection.
Anyone is entitled to access to documents pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act and the Environmental Information Act and has a right to familiarise himself or herself with alternative drafts of plans pursuant to this Act at the office of the authority concerned, including documents on which the draft plans are based with the exceptions that follow from chapter 3 of the Freedom of Information Act.
The Ministry is the administrative appeals body for individual decisions pursuant to this Act.
