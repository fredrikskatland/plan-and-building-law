Section 19-1. Application for dispensation
Dispensation requires a reasoned application. Before a decision is made, neighbours shall be notified by means as mentioned in section 21-3. Special notification is however not necessary where the application for dispensation is filed at the same time as an application for a permit pursuant to chapter 20, or where the application clearly does not affect the neighbours’ interests. Regional and central government authorities whose field of responsibility is affected directly shall have an opportunity to express their views before dispensation is granted from plans, planning requirements and the prohibition in section 1-8.
