Section 9-1. Intermunicipal planning cooperation
Two or more municipalities should cooperate on planning pursuant to this Act when it is expedient to coordinate planning across municipal borders. Cooperation may encompass all types of municipal plans.
Intermunicipal planning cooperation may be initiated as the implementation of a regional planning strategy. The regional planning authority or central government authorities may request municipalities to enter into such cooperation when it is considered necessary in order to safeguard considerations and discharge functions that extend beyond the individual municipality.
When it is considered necessary in order to safeguard and discharge national and important regional considerations and functions, the Ministry may order municipalities to enter into such planning cooperation. In this respect, it may decide how the planning cooperation is to be organised, to which functions such cooperation shall apply and which geographical area it shall cover. Before such provisions are made, the municipalities in question shall have been given an opportunity to express their views.
