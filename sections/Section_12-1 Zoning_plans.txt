Section 12-1.Â Zoning plans
The zoning plan is a land-use plan map with appurtenant provisions specifying use, conservation and design of land and physical surroundings.
The municipal council shall see to the preparation of a zoning plan for those areas in the municipality where this follows from the Act or from the land-use element of the municipal master plan, and where there is otherwise a need to ensure proper planning clarification and implementation of building and construction projects, multi-use development and conservation in relation to affected private and public interests.
A zoning plan is required for the implementation of major building and construction projects and other projects which may have substantial effects on the environment and society. Permits pursuant to section 20-1, see section 21-4, for such projects, may not be granted until a zoning plan exists. Zoning plan requirements do not apply to licensable sites for the production of energy pursuant to the Energy Act, Water Resources Act or Watercourse Regulation Act.
A zoning plan may take the form of an area zoning plan, see section 12-2, or a detailed zoning plan, see section 12-3.
A zoning plan may be prepared in conjunction with the land-use element of the municipal master plan or as a separate planning process.
The King may by regulation establish technical quality requirements for zoning plans and make further provisions concerning the classification of land-use objectives, planning provisions and consideration of zoning plans.
