Section 10-1.  The municipal planning strategy
The municipal council shall at least once in each electoral term, and not later than within one year after it has been constituted, prepare and adopt a municipal planning strategy. The planning strategy should comprise a discussion of the municipality’s strategic choices related to social development, including long-term land use, environmental challenges, sector activities and an assessment of the municipality’s planning needs during the electoral term.
When working on the municipal planning strategy, the municipality shall solicit the views of central government and regional bodies and neighbouring municipalities. The municipality should also promote broad public participation and general debate as a basis for the municipal council’s consideration of the strategy. Proposals for municipal council decisions shall be made public at least 30 days before they are to be considered by the municipal council.
When considering the strategy the municipal council shall determine whether the current municipal master plan or parts of it shall be revised, or whether the plan shall be continued without alterations. The municipal council may in this connection determine whether it is necessary to commence work on new land-use plans during the electoral term, or whether current plans should be revised or revoked.
The processes of preparing and considering a municipal planning strategy may be combined with and become part of the initial stages of work on the municipal master plan, see chapter 11.
