Section 6-3. Central government planning provisions
When it is necessary in order to safeguard national or regional interests, the King may, after consultation with the affected municipalities and regional planning authorities, impose a prohibition for a period not exceeding ten years on certain specified building or installation projects being implemented without the consent of the Ministry in delimited geographical areas, or in the entire country, or may decide that without such consent such projects may only be implemented in accordance with the binding land-use element of the municipal master plan or the zoning plan pursuant to this Act. The King may extend the prohibition by five years at a time.
Before a decision is made, a proposal for a provision shall be circulated for comment and presented for public scrutiny in the municipalities affected with a time limit of six weeks for comment, and be made available in at least one newspaper that is commonly read in the locality and through electronic media.
Central government planning provisions shall, after the decision is made, be announced in the Norwegian Legal Gazette and made known to all affected public bodies, interested organisations and institutions, and the public at large.
